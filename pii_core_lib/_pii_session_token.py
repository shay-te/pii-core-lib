order matters (overlap resolver in the scrubber picks the

    # always begins with ``eyJ`` because it's the base64 encoding of
    # ``{"`` (the JSON header's opening). That prefix makes JWTs
    # distinctive enough to flag without the false-positive risk of a
    # bare ``segment.segment.segment`` shape. Length floors of 10 per
    # segment keep us from matching short ``a.b.c`` text-fragments that
    # happen to start with ``eyJ``. Tokens routinely encode user id,
    # email, tenant id, and roles in the payload segment — even though
    # they're "credential material" they're PII shape from the model's
    # perspective and we want them out.
