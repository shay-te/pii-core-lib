"""Structured-payload PII scanner + scrubber.

This is the runtime backstop the admin-backend wires into its LLM
tool-result boundary. Four entry points, all reading the workspace's
single source of truth — :mod:`pii_core_lib.pii_patterns`:

* :func:`find_pii_in_payload` — non-throwing scan over ``dict`` /
  ``list`` / ``tuple`` / ``str``; returns a list of
  :class:`~pii_core_lib.pii_patterns.PIIPatternFinding` so
  callers can log / count / inspect.
* :func:`assert_no_pii` — raises :class:`PIIDetectedError` if anything
  matched. The test-suite hook for locking the contract that a given
  tool's payload is PII-free.
* :func:`scrub_pii` — recursive rewrite of strings inside the payload,
  replacing every match with ``[redacted:<pattern>]``. Containers are
  walked and rebuilt; non-text primitives (``int`` / ``bool`` /
  ``None`` / ``Decimal`` / ``date``) pass through untouched.
* :func:`scrub_pii_with_findings` — same walk as :func:`scrub_pii`
  but also returns the list of findings, in one pass. Used by
  :class:`PiiService` so the service's ``validate`` and ``scrub``
  methods only scan the payload once.

The text-stream WARNING-log helper lives in
:mod:`pii_core_lib.pii_scan`; this module is for *payloads*
the host app is about to hand to a model.
