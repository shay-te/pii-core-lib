    """WARNING-log credential AND phishing patterns found in ``text``.

    Two pattern families fire:

      * **Credential patterns** (residual #18) — pattern name +
        redacted preview only; the full credential value is never
        logged. Operators who see this should rotate the named
        credential. The agent's text has already crossed to the model
        provider by the time the result returns, so this is an audit
        trail not a block.
      * **Phishing patterns** (residual #16, defense-in-depth) — agent
        output that looks like an attempt to trick the operator into
        running shell commands on their host (``curl|bash``, ``sudo``
        snippets, ``eval $(curl …)``). Same audit-trail treatment.

    ``context_label`` is the descriptor woven into the WARNING messages
    (e.g. ``'Claude response for triage investigation'`` or
    ``'streaming Claude session for task PROJ-1'``). Blank ``text`` is a
    no-op.
