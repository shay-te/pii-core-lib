"""Shared output-side PII scan for agent text streams.

Parallel to :mod:`agent_core_lib.helpers.credential_scan` — the
credential scan WARNING-logs vendor-issued secret patterns that leaked
into agent output; this scan does the same for personal data (email,
SSN, phone, credit card, IBAN). Both are detective-only — by the time
the agent's text is being scanned, it has already crossed to / from the
model provider, so the log line is an auditable record (rotate /
respond), never a block.

Pattern names + redacted previews are logged; the raw matched value is
never logged. The patterns themselves live in
:mod:`pii_core_lib.pii_patterns` — the workspace's single
source of truth (``llm-core-lib`` no longer carries a copy; its safety
subpackage owns only the *structural* defenses — ``LLMView`` +
``to_llm_payload`` — and leaves regex PII detection to this module).
