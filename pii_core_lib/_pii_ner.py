"""NER-based PII detection — names / organisations / locations.

Powered by spaCy. The library is an *optional* extra (not in
``requirements.txt``) because the English model adds ~12MB and most
chat-tool flows don't need free-text name detection. Callers that
do want it install via ``pip install 'pii-core-lib[ner]'`` (the
extra is wired in ``setup.py``) and call :func:`find_ner_pii`.

If spaCy isn't installed, :func:`find_ner_pii` raises
:class:`SpacyNotInstalledError` at first call — the import is lazy so
the dependency is only required when the function is actually used.
